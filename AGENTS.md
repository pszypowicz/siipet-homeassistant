# Instructions for coding agents

This file tells coding agents how to work in this repo. Humans can read it too.

## Project

This repo is a Home Assistant custom integration for SiiPet LitterLens litter box cameras.
It uses the SiiPet cloud API. HACS installs it from `custom_components/siipet/`.
The minimum Home Assistant version is 2026.9.0.

## Layout

## Boundaries

- `api/` imports only `aiohttp`, `cryptography`, and the standard library.
  Home Assistant ships both packages, so `manifest.json` has no requirements.
- Entities read only `coordinator.data`. They never call the client.
- `SiiPetData.cat_ids(visit)` decides which cats own a visit.
  A visit with no known cat belongs to the virtual Unknown cat (`UNKNOWN_CAT_ID`).
- `api/edits.py` has no I/O. `plan_edit` returns the calls, and `services.py` sends them.
- After a delete, `services.py` awaits `mirror.async_forget`, which deletes the local files of the visit.
- After an edit or a delete, `services.py` drops the day from the older-day cache of `SiiPetMedia`
  and its month from the calendar cache, then calls `async_refresh_day`.
- S3 credentials stay inside `api/`. Other modules get signed URLs from `S3Signer`.
- Only `media_store.py` writes to the media folder. It keeps the local copy in `.siipet`,
  and a file name holds an id only if the id matches `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`.
  The views never build a path from a request. They look up the store index.
- Only `media_source.py` returns a signed S3 URL, and only for a recording that the local copy does not hold.
  Images go through the image view in `views.py`, so their signed URLs stay inside Home Assistant.
- The card commands in `websocket_api.py` sign image view paths for the logged-in user. They return no S3 URL.
- The card reads only through the `siipet/*` websocket commands and `media_source/resolve_media`.
  It writes only through `siipet.update_visit` and `siipet.delete_visit`.
- The card reuses internal tile parts of the Home Assistant frontend. `frontend/src/tile-parts.ts` lists them.
  If a part is missing, the card names it and shows nothing else.

## API facts that are easy to get wrong

Read `docs/api.md` before you change `api/`. These points cause most mistakes:

- Every call is a `POST` with a JSON body, also for reads.
- A response is `{"Code", "Msg", "Data"}`. `Code` 0 means success.
- Timestamps and durations are in milliseconds.
- Visit `Type`: 0 unknown, 1 lingering, 2 poop, 3 pee.
- The calendar counts only pee and poop. The visit counts in this integration use the same rule.
- A visit is abnormal when its type is pee or poop, and `FecesAbnormal` has a positive code or `EventAbnormal > 0`.
- `x-timezone` changes how the server groups visits into days.
- In the annotate call, `Result` is a JSON string, and the outer `Type` is the operation, not the visit type.
- Operation 2 of annotate with `GonePotty` true makes the app assume poop. A pee visit needs operation 3 after it.
- The recordings use H.265 video.
- The server checks `x-device-model`. Values that start with `iPhone` or `android-phone` work. With a rejected value, every authenticated call fails with `Code` -2. The `Msg` then says that another device logged in, but that is not the cause.
- Sign-in succeeds even with a rejected model, so the config flow reads the cats once before it creates the entry.
- Email code requests are limited per day (`Code` 10010).

## Privacy

This repo is public. Keep these values out of commits, tests, logs, and entity attributes:

- Tokens, emails, and passwords.
- Camera serial numbers, `UserId`, `GroupId`, `PetId`, and messaging topics.
- S3 credentials, the bucket name, media keys, and signed URLs.
- Raw API captures. Build test fixtures from the documented shapes with fake values.

Entity attributes can contain cat names, camera names, event IDs, types, durations, and abnormal data.
When you add a field that holds a private value, add its key to `TO_REDACT` in `diagnostics.py`.

## Commands

Set up a Python 3.14 environment and install the test requirements:

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

Run the tests and the linters:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest
.venv/bin/ruff check .
.venv/bin/ruff format --check .
```

The card build needs Node.js 24 or later. Run the card checks in `frontend/`:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run check
```

`npm run check` runs prettier, the type check, the tests, and the build.
The build writes `custom_components/siipet/frontend/siipet-visits-card.js`.
Commit that file together with the source change, because HACS installs only `custom_components/siipet/`.
CI fails when the committed file differs from a new build.

## Tests

- Write the test first, then the code.
- Integration tests mock `SiiPetClient` with the fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`.
- Client tests mock HTTP with the `aioclient_mock` fixture.
- Card tests define stub tile parts, because the Home Assistant frontend is not available in tests.
- Tests run in UTC with the time frozen at 2026-09-26 12:00.
- The entry fixtures turn the local media copy off. Tests of the copy use `setup_mirror` in `tests/common.py`.

## Style

- Use American English.
- Do not use em dashes. Use a single `-`.
- Write docs and UI strings in short, plain sentences.
- Comments explain why. Do not restate the code.

## Live checks

Some API behavior is known only from the vendor app code. `docs/api.md` lists the open points.

- Read calls against a real account are safe.
- Edits and deletes change real data. Use only a visit that the account owner picks for tests.
- Record each result in `docs/api.md`.
